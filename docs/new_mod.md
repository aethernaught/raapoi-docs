# New Module System

In 2020 we started building packages and organising them into modules[^1] in a new way.  In the new system modules are organised into toolchains[^2].  These toolchains were used to build the software. For most users the most imporant thing is these these toolchains act like software "silos". 

In general this restricts you to using using programs in one toolchain "silo".  This is on the face of it, is annoying.  However, it resolves some very hard to diagnose and subtle bugs that occur when you load programs that are built with different compilers - in the old system this was not transparent to you.

Before you module load a toolchain the software contained within will not be visible to module loading (except via module spider).  You first need to load the compiler and MPI version the software was built with. For example, if you wanted to load `BioPython/1.79` you would first need to load `GCC/10.3.0` and `OpenMPI/4.1.1`

To save you needing to load both a Compiler and MPI version, the compiler and MPI versions are bundled into half yearly packs.  For example `GCC/10.3.0 and OpenMPI/4.1.1` are bundled in the meta module `foss/2021a`


```mermaid
graph TD;
    LMOD["Module System"] --toolchain --- foss2020b["foss2020b <br> GCC/10.2.0 OpenMPI/4.0.5"]
    LMOD --toolchain --- foss2021a["foss2021a <br> GCC/10.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.1"]
    foss2020b --- id3["ORCA/4.2.1"]
    foss2020b --- id4["Singularity/3.7.3"]
    foss2021a --- id5["Biopython/1.79"]
    foss2021a --- id6["Haploflow/1.0"]
```

<br />

Example loading `BioPython/1.7.9`
```bash
# loading the modules
module load foss/2021a  # Needed for biopython to be loadable
module load BioPython/1.7.9
```

## Searching for Software with Spider

As the software is siloed into toolchains methods for finding software like `module avail` are less useful than in the old system - it will only show software loadable in the current toolchain silo, or if no tooclahin silos are loaded it'll show you all the toolchains as well as software that's not tied to a toolchain.

We can use `module spider` to search for software modules more broadly - it will also show what toolchain needs to be loaded first.

If we wanted to load a version of netCDF, we could search for it with spider.  Note spider searches in a case sensite manner - but it will suggest other capitalisation if other search options exist.
```bash
module spider netCDF
```

This returns a lot of information, but the important bit is:
```bash

-------------
  netCDF:
-------------
    Description:
      NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries
      and machine-independent data formats that support
      the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific
      data. 

     Versions:
        netCDF/4.7.1
        netCDF/4.7.4
        netCDF/4.8.0

--------------
  For detailed information about a specific "netCDF" module (including
  how to load the modules) use the modules full name.
  For example:

     $ module spider netCDF/4.7.1
--------------
```

We have 3 versions of netCDF available in the new module system, `4.7.1`,`4.7.4` and `4.8.0`.  To see which toolchain needs to be loaded, we spider that particular version
```bash
module spider netCDF/4.7.1

#returns
----------
  netCDF: netCDF/4.7.1
----------
    Description:
      NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries 
      and machine-independent data formats that support
      the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific
    data. 

    You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below 
    before the "netCDF/4.7.1" module is available to load.

      GCC/8.3.0  OpenMPI/3.1.4
 
    Help:
      
      Description
      ===========
      NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries 
       and machine-independent data formats that support the creation,
       access, and sharing of array-oriented 
       scientific data.

      ================
       - Homepage: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/
```

This gives some information about the software as well as what we need to load it, in this case `GCC/8.3.0` and `OpenMPI/3.1.4`.  We can just use that and load netcdf -
```bash
#Load prerequisites - the "silo"
module load GCC/8.3.0
module load OpenMPI/3.1.4

#Load NetCDF
module load netCDF
```

Alternativly you could load the toolchain containing `gcc/8.3.0` and `OpenMPI/3.1.4` - `foss/2019b`
```bash
#Load prerequisites - the "silo"
module load foss/2019b

#Load NetCDF
module load netCDF
```


## Toolchain "silo" table

Toolchains currently on RƒÅpoi as of May 2022.

Toolchain  | Compiler   | MPI
:---------:|:----------:|:-------------:
foss/2018b | GCC/7.3.0  | OpenMPI/3.1.1
foss/2019b | GCC/8.3.0  | OpenMPI/3.1.4
foss/2020a | GCC/9.3.0  | OpenMPI/4.0.3
foss/2020b | GCC/10.2.0 | OpenMPI/4.0.5
foss/2021a | GCC/10.3.0 | OpenMPI/4.1.1

There are also tooclahin versions with CUDA for use on the GPU nodes - they contain the same compiler and OpnMPI but also include a CUDA version


Toolchain  | Compiler   | MPI           | CUDA
:---------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:--------------:
foss/2019b | GCC/8.3.0  | OpenMPI/3.1.4 | CUDA/10.1.243
foss/2020b | GCC/10.2.0 | OpenMPI/4.0.5 | CUDA/11.1.1


You can also just experimentally module load the various toolchains and list to see what the module loads to see what it contains.

#load toolchain
module load foss/2020b

# List what it loads

[^1]: 
    Modules are the way programs are packaged up for you to use.  We can't just install them system wide as we have hundreds of programs installed in modules, often with many versions of the same thing, they would conflict with each other.  Modules let you load just what you need. See [Preparing your enviroment](environment.md)

[^2]:
    The toolchain is comprised of a compiler and a version of MPI that was used to build the software.  For instance the tooclhain foss/2021a uses GCC/10.3.0 and OpenMPI/4.1.1
