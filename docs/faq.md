# Frequently Asked Questions

*  *I don't want to interfere with other people work, what does it mean "Other users are prevented from using resources you request, even if you don't use them"?*  
    * The system is shared, you will very rarely have full use of a node.  You need to be careful to request resources, leaving the extra space available to others.  For example, say you submitted a job to bigmem which asked for 800GB of ram and 10 CPUs.  Your job would end up on the node with 1000GB ram as only that one would fit it - if your job actually only used 300GB of ram - the extra 500GB of ram you requested would be "wasted" no one else could use it.  So, another user with a job requesting 600GB of ram would have to wait for your job to end even if there was space for it to run alongside yours.

    * The same issue occurs with CPU requests.   It can be very hard to accurately estimate memory and cpu needs before running your job.  If your job has a short run time (less than ~10 hours), you can just request more than you need and check the memory usage afterward to guide further jobs.  If your job has a long run time (several days), you should run a test job with a  short runtime (a few hours) to estimate your needs first.
