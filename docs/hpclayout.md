# HPC layout

To a first approximation a High Performance Computer (HPC) is a collection of large computers or servers (nodes) that are connected together.  There will also be some attached storage.

Rather than logging into the system and immediatly running your program or code, it is organsed into a job and submitted to a scheduler that takes your job and runs it on one of the nodes that has enough free resources (cpu and memory) to meet your job request.  Most of the time you will be sharing a node with other users.  

It is imporant to try and not over request resources as requested resourses are kept in reserve for you and not available to others, even if you don't use them. This is particularly important when requesting a lot of resoruces or running array jobs which can use up a lot of the HPCs resourses. 

On Rapoi the node you login into and submit your jobs to is called `raapoi-master`. 

On RƒÅpoi the nodes are connected to each other in 2 ways - via 10G ethernet and via 40G infiniband.  Most of the time you can ignore this, but it is important for interconnected jobs running accross multiple nodes like weather simulations.

The computers/servers making up the nodes are of serveral types, covered in [partitions](partitions.md).
